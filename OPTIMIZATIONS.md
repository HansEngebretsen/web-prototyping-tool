# Optimizations Guide

This document outlines a detailed and prioritized plan to optimize and modernize the Web Prototyping Tool. The focus is on front-end technologies and best practices, without significantly altering the application's core functionality.

## 1. High-Priority: Foundational Upgrades

These upgrades are critical for security, performance, and future development.

### 1.1. Angular Upgrade

- **Upgrade to the latest Angular version:** The application is currently on Angular 12. Upgrading to the latest stable version of Angular is the most important step. This will provide significant performance improvements, new features (like Signals), and better security. The upgrade should be done incrementally, following the official Angular upgrade guide.
- **Update Angular Material and CDK:** Ensure that the Angular Material and CDK libraries are also upgraded to compatible versions.
- **Update NgRx:** Upgrade NgRx to the latest version to take advantage of new features and performance improvements.

### 1.2. E2E Test Framework Migration

- **Migrate from Protractor to Playwright:** The project is currently using Protractor, which is deprecated. Migrating to a modern e2e testing framework like Playwright is essential for reliable testing. Playwright is recommended for its speed, reliability, and cross-browser support.

## 2. Medium-Priority: Code Modernization

These changes will improve the developer experience and make the codebase more maintainable.

### 2.1. Adopt Modern Angular Features and Patterns

- **Embrace Standalone Components:** The latest versions of Angular have introduced standalone components, which can simplify the application's architecture by reducing the need for NgModules. A gradual migration to standalone components is recommended.
- **Use the `inject` function:** The `inject` function is a new way to inject dependencies into components and services. It's more flexible than constructor injection and can help to reduce boilerplate code.
- **Introduce Angular Signals:** Signals are a new reactive primitive in Angular that can help to simplify state management and improve performance. They are a good alternative to NgRx for local component state.

### 2.2. CSS Modernization

- **Adopt Native CSS Custom Properties:** The current CSS architecture uses a custom Sass-based solution for CSS variables. Migrating to native CSS custom properties will allow for dynamic theme switching and will remove the need for the `sass-utils/cssvars` dependency.
- **Promote Modern CSS Features:** Encourage the use of modern CSS features like Flexbox and Grid for layout, and `clamp()` for responsive typography.

## 3. Low-Priority: Code Cleanup and Optimization

These changes will provide incremental performance improvements and will make the codebase cleaner and more efficient.

### 3.1. Code Bloat Reduction

- **Ensure tree-shaking is properly configured:** Verify that the Angular build process is properly configured to tree-shake unused code from the final bundle.
- **Identify and remove dead code:** Use a tool like `ts-prune` to identify and remove any unused code from the codebase.

### 3.2. Component Architecture

- **Promote the use of OnPush change detection:** Encourage the use of the `OnPush` change detection strategy for components to improve runtime performance.
- **Lazy load feature modules:** Identify any feature modules that can be lazy-loaded to reduce the initial bundle size.

## 4. Build and CI/CD Optimization

- **Enable build caching:** Configure the Angular CLI to use build caching to improve build times.
- **Optimize CI/CD pipeline:** Review the existing CI/CD pipeline and identify any opportunities to optimize it. This could include running tests in parallel or using a more efficient build process.
